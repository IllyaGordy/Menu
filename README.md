- TouchBistro - Mobile Challange
- By: Illya Gordiyenko
- Date: April 24th, 2018

## General:
- Version: iOS 10.0 +
- Swift 4.0

## Project Notes:
- There is not much commenting, but most of the code is fairly straight forward.
- I've kept track of my changes in the GIT, for further investigation on what I did, please read that.

## Bugs and Future Improvements:
Not full implementation, but have done the majority for the functionality. Future improvements:
1. Create an 'Add' for group that opens in from the GroupViewController
2. Add the same image browser + uploaded to the Group as it has been done in Item
3. More Unit Tests for the Item + update group
4. Better UI, improve the style of all of the tableViews + detailed views. Should optimize for the photos better
5. Do more testing for the edge cases
